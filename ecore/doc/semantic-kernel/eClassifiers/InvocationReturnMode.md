## InvocationReturnMode Enum

The `InvocationReturnMode` is an enumeration in the `com.microsoft.semantickernel.orchestration` package, which defines the mode in which a function invocation should return its results. This enum is part of the Microsoft Semantic Kernel Java library (`semantickernel-api:1.4.0`).

### Fields

- **FULL_HISTORY**
  - Returns the full history of messages for function invocations that build upon a history of previous invocations, such as in Chat Completions.
  
- **LAST_MESSAGE_ONLY**
  - Returns only the last message generated by the given invocation for functions that build upon a history of previous invocations.
  
- **NEW_MESSAGES_ONLY**
  - (Default) Returns only the new messages generated by the given invocation for functions that build upon a history of previous invocations.

### Usage Example

Here's how you might use the `InvocationReturnMode` enum in a Java context:

```java
import com.microsoft.semantickernel.orchestration.InvocationReturnMode;
import com.microsoft.semantickernel.orchestration.InvocationContext;

// Example: Creating an InvocationContext with a specific InvocationReturnMode
InvocationContext invocationContext = new InvocationContext.Builder()
    .withReturnMode(InvocationReturnMode.FULL_HISTORY)
    .build();
```

In this example, an `InvocationContext` is being built with the return mode set to `FULL_HISTORY`, suggesting that the full conversational history will be retained for the given function invocation. Similarly, you can set it to `LAST_MESSAGE_ONLY` or `NEW_MESSAGES_ONLY` according to your needs.
