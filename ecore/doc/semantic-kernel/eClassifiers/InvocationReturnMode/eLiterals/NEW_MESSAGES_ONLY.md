The `InvocationReturnMode` enum in Microsoft Semantic Kernel Java is part of the `com.microsoft.semantickernel.orchestration` package. It defines the mode in which a function invocation should return its results. One of the options available in this enum is `NEW_MESSAGES_ONLY`.

### `NEW_MESSAGES_ONLY`
This mode specifies that function invocations which build upon a history of previous invocations, such as Chat Completions, will return only new messages generated by the given invocation. This means that when a function is invoked, only the messages that were newly created during this specific invocation are returned, rather than a full or partial history of previous invocations.

#### Example Usage in Java
Here is an example snippet showcasing how you might utilize the `NEW_MESSAGES_ONLY` mode:

```java
import com.microsoft.semantickernel.orchestration.InvocationReturnMode;
import com.microsoft.semantickernel.services.chatcompletion.ChatCompletionService;

// Assume chatCompletionService is properly initialized
ChatCompletionService chatCompletionService = ...

InvocationContext invocationContext = new InvocationContext.Builder()
    .withReturnMode(InvocationReturnMode.NEW_MESSAGES_ONLY)
    .build();

// Assume history and kernel are already defined
ChatHistory history = new ChatHistory();
history.addUserMessage("Hello, what's the weather today?");

List<ChatMessageContent<?>> results = chatCompletionService
    .getChatMessageContentsAsync(history, kernel, invocationContext)
    .block();

// Print only new messages generated during the invocation
for (ChatMessageContent<?> result : results) {
    System.out.println(result.getContent());
}
```

In this example, when invoking the chat completion service, it only returns new messages generated from the latest invocation, which is useful in cases where you want to track changes or updates without revisiting the entire history of interactions.
